I create this web bcs feel frustrated, so mostly beasiswa UI web are freaky. If my grandma would wake up from death again and give the option to see the Franky website UI or back to the emptiness, probably my grandma would choose emptiness.

Even though I found some website with a great UI, I found it pretty funny bcs just to fckin' list the some parameter, you have to be a fckin' member. I think this is my what the f*ck moment. Even though the web not better than he has, at least I'm trying.

I really grateful for the Tailwind blog for the UI and I can use it for free.
